BASH : Contains the full pathname of the bash command. This is usually
/bin/bash.

BASH_VERSION : A number representing the current version of the bash command.

EUID : This is the effective user ID number of the current user. It is assigned when
the shell starts, based on the user’s entry in the /etc/passwd fi le.

FCEDIT : If set, this variable indicates the text editor used by the fc command to
edit history commands. If this variable isn’t set, the vi command is used.

HISTFILE : The location of your history fi le. It is typically located at $HOME/
.bash_history.

HISTFILESIZE : The number of history entries that can be stored. After this number is
reached, the oldest commands are discarded. The default value is 1000.

HISTCMD : This returns the number of the current command in the history list.

HOME : This is your home directory. It is your current working directory each time
you log in or type the cd command with any options.

HOSTTYPE : A value that describes the computer architecture on which the Linux
system is running. For Intel-compatible PCs, the value is i386, i486, i586,
i686, or something like i386-linux. For AMD 64-bit machines, the value
is x86_64.

MAIL : This is the location of your mailbox fi le. The fi le is typically your username
in the /var/spool/mail directory.

OLDPWD : The directory that was the working directory before you changed to the
current working directory.

OSTYPE : A name identifying the current operating system. For Fedora Linux, the

OSTYPE : value is either linux or linux-gnu, depending on the type of
shell you are using. (Bash can run on other operating systems as well.)

PATH : The colon-separated list of directories used to fi nd commands that you type.
The default value for regular users varies for different distributions, but typi-
cally includes the following: /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin/
X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:~/bin. You need to type the full path or a relative
path to a command you want to run that is not in your PATH. For the root
user, the value also includes /sbin, /usr/sbin, and /usr/local/sbin.

PPID  : The process ID of the command that started the current shell
(for example, the Terminal window containing the shell).

PROMPT_COMMAND : Can be set to a command name that is run each time before your shell
prompt is displayed. Setting PROMPT_COMMAND=date lists the current date/
time before the prompt appears.

PS1 : Sets the value of your shell prompt. There are many items that you can
read into your prompt (date, time, username, hostname, and so on).
Sometimes a command requires additional prompts, which you can set
with the variables PS2, PS3, and so on.

PWD : This is the directory that is assigned as your current directory. This value
changes each time you change directories using the cd command.

RANDOM : Accessing this variable causes a random number to be generated.
The number is between 0 and 99999.

SECONDS : The number of seconds since the time the shell was started.

SHLVL : The number of shell levels associated with the current shell session. When
you log in to the shell, the SHLVL is 1. Each time you start a new bash com-
mand (by, for example, using su to become a new user, or by simply typing
bash), this number is incremented.

TMOUT : Can be set to a number representing the number of seconds the
shell can be idle without receiving input. After the number of seconds
is reached, the shell exits. This security feature makes it less likely for unat-
tended shells to be accessed by unauthorized people.
(This must be set in the login shell for it to actually cause the shell
to log out the user.)
